# Project Guidelines

## Important

- Write production-ready code
- Prefer small focused files
- Add comments only when necessary
- Prefer explicitness over magic
- Preserve existing architecture and conventions
- Follow existing project patterns before introducing new ones
- Prefer extending existing code over introducing new abstractions
- Reuse existing utilities before creating new ones
- Do not refactor unrelated code unless explicitly requested
- Split overly complex files into smaller modules
- Prefer minimal diffs
- Avoid reformatting unrelated code
- Prefer readable and maintainable code
- Prefer simplicity over clever abstractions
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions

---

## TypeScript Rules

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any`
- Prefer explicit types for public APIs
- Prefer `type` over `interface`
- Use discriminated unions when appropriate
- Prefer readonly where possible
- Avoid unnecessary generics

---

## Testing Rules

- Tests must be deterministic
- Keep tests readable and explicit
- Avoid duplicated setup logic
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate
- Keep unit and integration tests isolated

### Test Structure

- Negative test cases must go first
- Positive test cases must go after negative cases
- Negative and positive cases must be placed in separate `describe` blocks
- Separate describe blocks with an empty line
- Keep test structure consistent across the project

Example:

```ts
describe('UsersService', () => {
  describe('negative cases', () => {
    it('throws when user does not exist', async () => {});
  });

  describe('positive cases', () => {
    it('returns user by id', async () => {});
  });
});
```

---

## Ignore Rules

Do not analyze or modify generated/dependency files.

Ignore:

- node_modules
- dist
- build
- coverage
- \*.generated.ts
- package-lock.json
- yarn.lock
- pnpm-lock.yaml

Never edit generated code manually.

---

## Cost Saving Rules

- Run only affected tests when possible
- Do not run the entire test suite for small isolated changes
- If only one test file was modified, run only that test file
- If only one module/service/controller changed, avoid unrelated validations
- Read only files relevant to the current task
- Avoid scanning the entire repository unless necessary
